BUILDING INSPECTION REPORT
Property Address: 456 Oak Avenue, Springfield
Date of Inspection: August 3, 2025
Inspector: John Mitchell, Licensed Building Inspector

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
This 1950s two-story residential property exhibits multiple significant defects requiring immediate attention before occupancy. Several critical structural and safety issues were identified during the comprehensive inspection.

FOUNDATION AND STRUCTURAL:
The concrete foundation shows extensive cracking along the north wall, with cracks measuring up to 5mm in width. Water infiltration through these foundation cracks has caused moisture damage to the basement walls. The main support beam in the basement exhibits a noticeable sag of approximately 2 inches at the center span, indicating potential structural failure. Load-bearing walls show stress fractures near window openings.

ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS:
The electrical panel dates from 1965 and contains obsolete circuit breakers that pose serious fire hazards. Multiple outlets throughout the property lack proper grounding, creating safety risks. Exposed wiring was observed in the basement workshop area. The main electrical service entrance shows signs of corrosion and requires immediate replacement by a licensed electrician.

PLUMBING DEFECTS:
Galvanized steel pipes in the kitchen and main bathroom show severe corrosion and restricted water flow. The main water line has multiple leak points where it enters the foundation. Water pressure on the second floor is insufficient due to pipe deterioration. The master bathroom toilet shows signs of movement, suggesting floor damage beneath.

ROOFING ISSUES:
Missing and damaged shingles across 30% of the roof surface allow water penetration. The chimney flashing is severely deteriorated, with obvious water stains on interior walls below. Gutters are clogged and pulling away from the roofline. The roof membrane around the skylight has failed, causing water damage to the ceiling below.

HVAC CONCERNS:
The heating system is over 25 years old and operates inefficiently. Ductwork in the crawl space has multiple disconnections and lacks proper insulation. The air conditioning unit shows refrigerant leaks and requires professional attention. Ventilation in the basement is inadequate, contributing to moisture problems.

MOISTURE AND MOLD:
Extensive mold growth was discovered in the basement, particularly along the foundation walls. Moisture levels throughout the lower level exceed acceptable standards. The bathroom exhaust fans are non-functional, leading to condensation damage. Black mold was identified in the master bedroom closet.

SAFETY HAZARDS:
Smoke detectors are either missing or non-functional throughout the property. The stairway handrail is loose and presents a fall hazard. Asbestos-containing materials were identified in the basement ceiling tiles. Lead paint is present on exterior trim and window frames. Emergency exits are blocked by storage in multiple areas.

PEST INFESTATION:
Evidence of rodent activity was found in the attic space and basement. Termite damage is visible in the wooden support posts in the basement. Wood-boring beetle damage was observed in the main floor joists.

COSMETIC DEFECTS:
Peeling paint throughout the interior, particularly in high-moisture areas. Cracked and missing tiles in both bathrooms. Hardwood floors show significant wear, scratches, and water damage near the kitchen sink.

URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Immediate structural engineering assessment of foundation and support beam
2. Complete electrical system replacement by licensed electrician
3. Professional mold remediation before any occupancy
4. Roof repairs to prevent further water damage
5. Asbestos abatement by certified professionals
6. Pest control and termite treatment
7. Plumbing system overhaul with modern materials

COST ESTIMATE:
Preliminary repair estimates range from $45,000 to $65,000 for critical items only. This property requires extensive renovation and should not be occupied in its current condition.

INSPECTOR CERTIFICATION:
This report represents the findings of a comprehensive inspection conducted in accordance with industry standards. All defects noted require professional evaluation and remediation.
