BUILDING SURVEY REPORT
Property: 123 Main Street, Springfield
Survey Date: July 15, 2025
Surveyor: John Smith, Chartered Building Surveyor

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This building survey report identifies several defects requiring attention, ranging from minor cosmetic issues to significant structural concerns that require immediate professional assessment.

STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS

Foundation and Sub-structure:
The foundation appears generally sound, however, there are visible cracks in the south-facing external wall measuring approximately 2mm wide and extending vertically for 800mm. This crack shows signs of recent movement and requires urgent structural engineer assessment. Settlement issues may be developing in the southeastern corner of the building.

Walls and Structure:
The main structural walls are in reasonable condition. However, significant damp penetration is evident in the north wall of the ground floor, with moisture readings exceeding acceptable levels. The wall shows visible staining and some surface deterioration. This damp issue requires immediate investigation and remediation.

ROOF AND EXTERNAL ELEMENTS

Roof Structure:
The roof structure shows signs of aging with several tiles displaced on the east elevation. Critical defect identified: missing flashing around the chimney area allowing water ingress. The guttering system requires major repairs with multiple blockages noted and several sections showing signs of deterioration.

External Doors and Windows:
Window frames in the rear elevation show significant rot in the lower sections. The front door requires adjustment as it does not close properly, creating a security and weather sealing issue.

INTERNAL ELEMENTS

Electrical Installation:
The electrical system requires urgent attention. Several safety hazards identified including exposed wiring in the basement area and an outdated fuse box that does not meet current regulations. This presents a serious safety risk and requires immediate professional electrical inspection.

Plumbing System:
Water pressure is inadequate throughout the property. Multiple leaks detected in the upstairs bathroom with water damage evident on the ceiling below. The main water pipe shows signs of corrosion and may require replacement.

Heating System:
The boiler is approaching end of life and showing signs of inefficient operation. Radiators in the living room and bedroom 2 are not heating adequately, suggesting possible blockages in the system.

INTERNAL FINISHES

Decorative Condition:
Paint work throughout requires refreshing. Several areas show minor cracks in the plaster work, particularly around door frames and windows. The kitchen tiles show some loose grouting that needs attention.

Flooring:
Floorboards in the upstairs hallway are loose and creaking, suggesting potential sub-floor issues. The bathroom flooring shows signs of water damage and may need replacement.

SERVICES AND AMENITIES

Insulation:
Thermal performance is poor with significant heat loss identified. The attic insulation is inadequate and requires upgrading to meet current energy efficiency standards.

Ventilation:
Poor ventilation in the bathroom has led to condensation issues and potential mold growth. Extractor fan requires replacement and additional ventilation may be necessary.

HEALTH AND SAFETY

Potential Asbestos:
Given the age of the property, there is potential for asbestos-containing materials in the roof tiles and internal finishes. Professional asbestos survey recommended before any renovation work.

Fire Safety:
No smoke alarms detected throughout the property. This presents a serious safety hazard and immediate installation is required.
